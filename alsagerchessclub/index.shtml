<p>
We are a friendly and established chess club about half way between Crewe and 
Stoke on Trent.
</p> 

<p>
Although small, we have a couple of teams in the 
<a href="https://www.northstaffschess.com/" target="_blank">NSDCA</a> 
divisions 3 and 5.  
</p> 

<p>
We'd love to get more people involved - either young or old, novices or seasoned
 players, or any level between.  
</p> 

<p>
