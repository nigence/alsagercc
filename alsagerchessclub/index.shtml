We are a friendly and established chess club about half way between Crewe and 
Stoke on Trent.
</p> 

<p>
Although small, we had a couple of teams in the 
<a href="https://www.northstaffschess.com/" target="_blank">NSDCA</a> 
divisions 3 and 5 before covid struck.  We hope and expect that the planned new season of over-the-board
chess will go ahead in October; but, like many teams, we have a diminished squad and will only field one team 
probably.
</p> 

<p>
We'd love to get more people involved - either young or old, novices or seasoned
 players, or any level between.  
</p> 

<p> 
If you'd like to play chess for fun, improve your game, or take part in competitive league chess, <a href="/find-us.shtml">come along</a> or <a href="/contact-us.shtml">contact us</a>.

Covid-19 was a pain!
</p>

<p>
It spoiled all the fun and cancelled all but online for ages 
(e.g. <a href="/covid.shtml">online covid-19 tournament</a>).
But, hopes are high for a return to normality now that the NSDCA have resolved to resume league play in October.
Check out our facebook page for details and news on resumption of regular meets as well as ad-hoc cafe chess.

<b>Sad news: </b>It is with great sadness that Alsager Chess Club announces the passing of John Smith. 
A true gentleman and friend to us all, he was a founding member of Broughton Arms Chess Club, a forerunner of 
the present Alsager Chess Club. He will be greatly missed and fondly remembered. 
Our sincere condolences go out to all his friends and family.
