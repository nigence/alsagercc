We are a friendly and established chess club about half way between Crewe and 
Stoke on Trent.
</p> 

<p>
Although small, we had a couple of teams in the 
<a href="https://www.northstaffschess.com/" target="_blank">NSDCA</a> 
divisions 3 and 5 before covid struck.  We hope and expect that the planned new season of over-the-board
chess will go ahead in October; but, like many teams, we have a diminished squad and will only field one team 
probably.
</p> 

<p>
We'd love to get more people involved - either young or old, novices or seasoned
 players, or any level between.  
</p> 

<p> 
If you'd like to play chess for fun, improve your game, or take part in competitive league chess, <a href="/find-us.shtml">come along</a> or <a href="/contact-us.shtml">contact us</a>.

<b>Covid-19 was a pain. But now we're back!</b>
</p>

<p>
It spoiled all the fun and cancelled all but online for ages.
But, we had a semi-normal league season last year after the NSDCA resolved to resume the league.
And, hopes are high for a completely normal league season in October.  Of course, covid is still out there. If you
feel symptoms, don't come out to play; even better is to take a test.
