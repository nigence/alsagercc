We are a friendly and established chess club about half way between Crewe and 
Stoke on Trent.
</p> 

<p>
Although small, we have a couple of teams in the 
<a href="https://www.northstaffschess.com/" target="_blank">NSDCA</a> 
divisions 3 and 5.  
</p> 

<p>
We'd love to get more people involved - either young or old, novices or seasoned
 players, or any level between.  
</p> 

<p> 
If you'd like to play chess for fun, improve your game, or take part in competitive league chess, <a href="/find-us.shtml">come along</a> or <a href="/contact-us.shtml">contact us</a>.

It has spoiled all the fun and, obviously, everything is cancelled. We will monitor the government
advice for when we can resume. In the meantime, checkout our
