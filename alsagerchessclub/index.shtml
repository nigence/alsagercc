We are a friendly and established chess club about half way between Crewe and 
Stoke on Trent.
</p> 

<p>
Although small, we expect to field at least a couple of teams in the 
<a href="https://www.northstaffschess.com/" target="_blank">NSDCA</a> 
this season and that this will be fully Over The Board post-pandemic. 
</p> 

<p>
We'd love to get more people involved - either young or old, novices or seasoned
 players, or any level between.  
</p>

<b>We retained the South Cheshire Shield!</b>
</p>

<p>
We celebrated a 3-1 win over Kidsgrove to secure retention of the trophy.  It bodes well for the coming season to have done so well in this summer league that was fully Over The Board with most local clubs participating.

<b>Covid-19 was a pain. But now we're back!</b>
</p>

<p>
It spoiled all the fun and cancelled all but online for ages;  
but, we expect to have a completely normal league season again from October.  Of course, covid is still out there. If you
feel symptoms, don't come out to play; even better is to take a test.
