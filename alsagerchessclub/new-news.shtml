          <h2>Fabulous season!  More to come!?</h2>
          <p> 
	  Alsager Chess Club are delighted to have done so well in the season just finished. 
          Check out the silver-ware <a href="/alsagerchessclub/honours.shtml">here</a>.

          <p> 
	  The juniors' session was super-popular (thanks to FIDE Master Jonathan Blackburn);  there was so much enjoyment and plenty of improvement all round.
          We think some of the older ones may play competitive league chess now - if they wish.
          </p>
          <p> 
	  We have entered 4 teams into the NSDCA league for this season.  
          This is a big progression from last year (when we had just 2) and is due to the rising popularity of the club
          and success of the junior's section.
          </p>
          <p> 
	  The A team proved their right to remain in the dizzy heights of the top division;  the B team is effectively promoted after winning division 3;
          a new C team is to cope with increased demand and popularity; and a new D team is intended for juniors and novices.
