          <h2>Pleasing start to new season</h2>
          <p> 
	  Alsager Chess Club can feel pleased by their strong start to the new season this week:
          </p>
          <p> 
	  The juniors' session is thriving, thanks to FM Jonathan Blackburn, and even the mums and dads are starting to play too!
          </p>
          <p> 
	  Yet another seasoned player joined - welcome.
          </p>
          <p> 
	  The B team opened with a 3-1 win in their division 3 match over Kidsgrove where there was plenty of last-seconds drama and cool heads required!
          </p>
          <p> 
	  We look forward to the 'A' team opening fixture - a week on Friday - in the dizzy heights of the top division!
