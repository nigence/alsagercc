          <h2>Tuesday evening club night in Alsager Cricket Club 7pm ish until ?</h2>
	  <p> 
Usually, every tuesday evening, there will be players in the pavillion at Alsager Cricket Club.
Our home league fixtures are on tuesdays; but, even when we have a match, there are often other players
available for a friendly game.

          <h2>Wednesday social chess in Alsager library 10am until noon </h2>
	  <p> 
Every wednesday, from 10am to 12noon, upstairs in Alsager public library, a group meets for informal, friendly, social chess.
You will not see chess clocks. But, you will see tea, coffee, and biscuits in very comfortable convivial surroundings. 
          </p>
          <p>
Usually, there's at least 5 boards running - so you never have to wait long for a game after dropping by.

It's advertised in Cheshire East council web pages as a suitable place to learn chess, and I cannot think of a nicer place to learn
 - it's a really lovely meet which makes me wish I was retired! I get along as often as I can. I especially like that some of the players visit local hostelry afterwards for further refreshment.
          </p>
          <h2>Other times - see facebook etc</h2>
	  <p> 
We support initiatives to encourage social chess in the district. 
There are cafe meets and other local libraries are often used also.
