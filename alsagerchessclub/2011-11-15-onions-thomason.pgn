[Event "NSDCA League"]  [Site "?"]  [Date "2011.11.15"]  [Round "?"]  [White "Sam Onions, 137."]  [Black "Alan Thomason, 141."]  [Result "1/2-1/2"]  [ECO "B09"]  [Annotator "Thomason,Alan"]  [PlyCount "49"]    1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nd7 3. f4 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Nc3 Ngf6 6. e5 {I took 15 minutes  over my next move - having realised that my opening play had left me in a  really bad position - how can things go so wrong after just 5 moves?  I have a  choice of two moves - either Ng4 or Ng8. I decided to undevelop  my knight and start again - maybe white has over-stretched?} Ng8 7. Bd3 dxe5 8.  fxe5 e6 $4 {I played this move very quickly - to assert some control over d5,  and also to allow my knight to move to e7 allowing castling. How may bad  decisions can I make in a single opening?  I have already lost tempi on the  knight retreat, and I cannot afford another pawn move here. Nh6 or Nb6  developing a piece would have been more natural.} 9. Qe2 $1 {One of many good  moves available to white - castle / Bg5 or Ne4 would also have been good.} Ne7  10. Bf4 c6 $2 {Why another pawn move? I have no idea why I played this - let’s  just call it an unhealthy obsession with controlling d5! Simple castling would  have been better here, or c5 to at least to challenge white’s domination of  the centre.} 11. Ne4 O-O 12. Bg5 Qa5+ 13. c3 Nd5 14. O-O Qb6 15. a3 $2 {Now I  felt better about my chances - a3 does not appear to do anything to improve  white’s position.  Nd6, defending the e5 pawn, or c4 would have been more to  the point.   I decided to take the offered pawn - white still has a marked  space advantage - but a pawn is worth a bit of trouble.} (15. Nd6 h6 16. Bh4 c5  17. Bg3 cxd4 18. Nxd4) 15... Nxe5 16. Nxe5 Bxe5 17. Kh1 Bg7 18. c4 Nc7 $4 {  Bad! You know sometimes when you fight against your own urge to make bad moves  - and lose the fight! In this case, I looked briefly - too briefly -  at f5 to  counter white’s king side initiative, but failed to follow through on simple  calculations to see that after f5,  the best that white could hope to achieve  was equaility.   After the text move - retreating my knight to c7 was just  wrong - my queen is very restricted, and is completely out of play on the  queenside.  So why did I play Nc7? Laziness- and also because I over-valued my  material advantage.} (18... f5 19. Nd6 (19. Nd2 h6 20. Bh4 Nf6 $17) (19. Nc5  $17 Nc7) 19... Nf6 $11) 19. c5 Qa5 20. b4 Qa4 21. Nf6+ $3 {Straight to the  point - my queen is completely out of play, and white quite correctly goes for  a direct attack on my king.} Kh8 $2 {Now white has a winning attack against my  king. BxN would have kept me in the game - just.} (21... Bxf6 22. Rxf6 Ne8 23.  Qe5 b6 24. Bh6 Ba6 25. Bxa6 Qxa6 26. Rf2 f6 27. Qxe6+ Rf7 28. Qxc6 Qb7 29. Qxb7  Rxb7 30. d5 $18) 22. Bc2 $2 {Qe5 was more to the point - this would have been  the winning move. Instead, Sam played c2 and offered me a  draw here.  I should  have accepted - what else do I have to play for? The team position was drawn  on all boards (2 to 5) so I declined - a noble gesture, but at this point, we  both missed the win by white (it’s not easy to see over the board), and I  still felt I was winning. In any case, Sam forced a draw by repetition - my  queen has nowhere to go.} (22. Qe5 Nd5 23. Bxg6 hxg6 24. Rf3 Nxf6 25. Bxf6)  22... Qb5 23. Bd3 Qa4 24. Bc2 Qb5 (24... Qa6 25.
