	<h2>Oct 2022</h2>
          <h2>Pleasing start to new season</h2>
          <p> 
	  Alsager Chess Club can feel pleased by their strong start to the new season this week:
          </p>
          <p> 
	  The juniors' session is thriving, thanks to FM Jonathan Blackburn, and even the mums and dads are starting to play too!
          </p>
          <p> 
	  Yet another seasoned player joined - welcome.
          </p>
          <p> 
	  The B team opened with a 3-1 win in their division 3 match over Kidsgrove where there was plenty of last-seconds drama and cool heads required!
          </p>
          <p> 
	  We look forward to the 'A' team opening fixture - a week on Friday - in the dizzy heights of the top division!
          </p>

	
	<h2>Sep 2022</h2>
         <h2>Alsager retain South Cheshire Shield</h2>
          <p> 
This summer-league resumed after 2 years suspension, due to covid, and we were delighted to run out winners thereby retaining the title.   Club chairman and secretary Andy Barker said :
          </p>
          <p> 
The annual summer chess competition, the South Cheshire Shield, was completed last night at Alsager Cricket Club, home to Alsager Chess Club.
          </p>
          <p> 
The final match was between Alsager and Kidsgrove with Alsager coming out 3-1 winners and taking the 2022 title. Alsager had been the title holders after the competition was last played, in 2019, and so retain the title.
          </p>
          <p> 
During the matches, Alsager fielded established and new players (we had players aged between 10 and 95 years old!) and all showed great commitment to the club. Club secretary Andy Barker congratulated all who took part and supported the teams' efforts. 
          </p>
          <p> 
Special thanks are due to the cricket club for their continued support.
          </p>
          <p> 
We look forward to the new full season starting in the Autumn; for anyone wanting to get involved, or simply play friendly chess games, please get in touch; all are welcome!
          </p>
	
          <h2>June 2022</h2>
          <p> 
Mood at the Alsager Chess Club AGM last night was upbeat.   Hopes are high that the NSDCA will run "normal" leagues post-pandemic, and our recent influx of players - some very strong and experienced - means we can field multiple teams, including one at the very highest level available.
Other great news is that we shall have a Lady Captain! 
The club remains committed to social play for all levels and ages - including juniors and beginners.
          </p>
          <h2>February 2022</h2>
          <p> 
Is this a record?  Alsager fielded a team with an age-gap between oldest and youngest of 85 years! 
The youngest was just 10 years old, and the oldest was 95.
          </p>
