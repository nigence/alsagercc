          <h2>June 2022</h2>
          <p> 
Mood at the Alsager Chess Club AGM last night was upbeat.   Hopes are high that the NSDCA will run "normal" leagues post-pandemic, and our recent influx of players - some very strong and experienced - means we can field multiple teams, including one at the very highest level available.
Other great news is that we shall have a Lady Captain! 
The club remains committed to social play for all levels and ages - including juniors and beginners.
          </p>
          <h2>February 2022</h2>
          <p> 
Is this a record?  Alsager fielded a team with an age-gap between oldest and youngest of 85 years! 
The youngest was just 10 years old, and the oldest was 95.
