          <h2> Social chess in Alsager library  </h2>
	  <p> 
Every wednesday, from 10am to 12noon, upstairs in Alsager public library, a group meets for informal, friendly, social chess.
You will not see chess clocks. But, you will see tea, coffee, and biscuits in very comfortable convivial surroundings. 
          </p>
          <p>
Usually, there's at least 5 boards running - so you never have to wait long for a game after dropping by.
          </p>

It's advertised in Cheshire East council web pages as a suitable place to learn chess, and I cannot think of a nicer place to learn
 - it's a really lovely meet which makes me wish I was retired! I get along as often as I can. I especially like that some of the players visit local hostelry afterwards for further refreshment.
