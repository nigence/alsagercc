          <h2> South Cheshire Shield</h2>
	  <p> 
After an impressive campaign - in which we were unbeated over the entire Summer league - we won the 2019 South Cheshire Shield trophy!  Congratulations are due to all our players. 
          </p>

The inaugural South Cheshire Shield was held in the summer of 2011. Originally organised  by Alan Thomason (Alsager), George Scattergood (Holmes Chapel) and Julian Cook (Kidsgrove), it was intended as an annual Summer Competition. Over the years, many local chess clubs have dipped into this tournament:
 
Newcastle joined in 2013. 
 
Holmes Chapel withdrew after the 2013 tournament. 
 
Crewe joined in 2014. 
 
Kidsgrove withdrew after the 2014 tournament. 
 
Fenton joined in 2016 along with a Crewe ‘B’ team. 
 
Fenton withdrew after the 2016 tournament.
