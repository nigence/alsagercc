Summary of how it went:
<br>- 4 short and quick chess games over an 8-day period arranged "Swiss style" between 11 and 18 April.
<br>- Covid-19 themed prizes and (optional) publicity for the top scoring players in each category.
<br>- Categories are simple: (1)chess club members; (2)non-members; and (3)junior non-members.
<br>- Entry is free. 
<br>- It's time-flexible : arrange to play each game in a 2-day window to suit you.  
<br>- Ideal for young players to get a taste of tournament chess.
          </p>

Depending on individual performances, each game could last between 1 and 40 minutes (15|10 time control).
