Bxc6+ bxc6 13. g3 $2 {BxNf4  would have kept the balance - the text move weakens white’s king side too much}  (13. Bxf4 Qxh4 14. Be3 O-O 15.

Black’s pawns are very weak on the king side, and white will be able to recover the pawn later without too much difficulty. With the text move, the  Bishop will be pinned and captured.  Play coud have continued} (18. Bd2 Qf7 19.  Rde1 Qf5 20. Re4 Qg4) 18... Rf5 $2 {This gives white an escape for his bishop.  Qf7 or Qf6 wins the bishop} (18... Qf6 19. Rhg1 Qxf4+) 19.
